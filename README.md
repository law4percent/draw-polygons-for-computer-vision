# Polygon Drawer: A Tool for Computer Vision

## Overview

This **Polygon Drawer** a web-based tool designed to help computer vision engineers and students label images or video frames by drawing polygons around specific areas. You can create these polygons, save them as "zones," and then download the data in a simple format that's easy to work with. It's a handy way to annotate images or video for projects.

- Download Data: Export your polygon zone data in a clean, text-based format for easy use.

## üñ•Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts for a faster workflow:
- Close Polygon (C)
- Save Zone (S)
- Undo Last Point (U)
- Quit/Reset (Q)

## Benefits for Computer Vision Projects
- **Customizable and Easy to Use**: Resize the canvas, upload images or videos, and switch between light and dark mode to suit your preferences.
- **Downloadable Data**: Download the zone data as plain text, ready for use in machine learning models without additional data wrangling.
- **Ideal for Research & Education**: Perfect for both professionals and students in computer vision, allowing for easy annotation and zone management.

## How to Use

1. **Upload an Image or Video**: Click the "Upload Video or Image" button to load an image or video onto the canvas.
2. **Draw Polygons**: Click on the canvas to create polygon vertices. Each click adds a point.
3. **Save Zones**: After creating your polygon, click "Save Zone" to save it.
4. **Undo Points**: Use the "Undo Last Point" button to remove the last point if you made a mistake.
5. **Close Polygon**: Click "Close Polygon" to close the polygon and finalize the zone.
6. **Delete Zones**: Use the dropdown to select and delete any previously created zone.
7. **Download Data**: Click "Download Zones" to download your zone data as a plain text file, ready for use in machine learning models.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- No server-side dependencies; everything is handled client-side for simplicity and speed.
